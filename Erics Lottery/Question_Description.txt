Eric's lottery is a new lottery sweeping the province.  It can be purchased at any Marie's Mini Mart.  To play Eric's lottery you choose 5 numbers between 1 and 15.  The numbers may repeat.

Use npm init and create a node/express server which:

1) When launched, generates a winning sequence for Eric's lotto at random

2) Has an api post route /api/checkticket which determines if a prize is won.  The route will receive the 5 numbers to check and will return what the prize is.

Prizes for Eric's lotto are as follows:

0 numbers match, "You Lose"

1 number matches, "$5"

2 numbers match, "$10"

3 numbers match, "$15"

4 number match, "$100"

5 numbers match, "$100000"

(have your server console log the winning numbers to help you test the api using postman)

Once you have tested the backend server using postman, the last step is to connect the front end to the back end.

In the frontend folder modify the lottery.js file so it makes a fetch request to the backend and then with the response it displays the number of matching numbers and the prize.
